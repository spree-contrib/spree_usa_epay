SpreeUsaEpay
============

*Please see the Versionfile for branches to use with older versions for Spree*

If use use the spree command line tool to install Spree to your project, it will
add spree_usa_epay to your Gemfile with the proper git references.

You can add this gem manually:

  gem 'spree_usa_epay', :git => 'git://github.com/spree/spree_usa_epay.git'


Once installed, the USA Epay Gateway should be available as a provider when defining Payment Methods in Spree.

4. Navigate to /admin/payment_methods and create a new payment method

5. Give it a name and select "Gateway::UsaEpay" as the provider. (see screenshot)

6. Save the payment method and it will refresh with additional options

7. Add your Source Key and Pin. You must create your Source Key with a
   Pin on the USA Epay website. They say the pin is optional, but
   spree_usa_epay requires it.

8. If you are using a Source Key on sandbox.usaepay.com check the "Test Mode" checkbox, otherwise
leave it unchecked to use the production EPay servers.
